# IMPORTANT: Make sure you use the server filesystem's default file seperator when specifying any file paths below
# The default file seperator on Unix (Mac/Linux) is "/" and is "\" on Windows
# Also, make sure any file paths you specify don't end with a file seperator

# How often to do backups (in minutes), set to -1 to disable automatic backups
delay: 60
# The priority of the backup thread, relative to the minimum priority
# This is set to zero by default so backups cause the least amount of server lag possible
# Minimum: 0, Maximum: 9
backup-thread-priority: 0
# How many backups to keep remotely before deleting the oldest one, set to -1 to disable automatic deletes
keep-count: 20
# How many backups to keep locally before deleting the oldest one, set to -1 to disable automatic deletes

# Should automatic backups be disabled if there hasn't been any new player activity since the last backup?

# Should backups run at specific days/times every week, instead of every so often?
scheduled-backups: false
# The timezone the times in the schedule are in
# Example timezones:
#   Chicago, USA: "-05:00"
#   Paris, France: "+02:00"
# Find your timezone: http://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/

# Expandable list of dates/times to back up
backup-schedule-list:
# An entry is comprised of two things:
#   - The day(s) to run the backup on
#   - The time to run the backup at
#
# The day(s) to run the backup on should be a list comprised of any of the following:
#   - Days of the week: "sunday", "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", or "saturday"
#   - Groups of days: "weekdays" or "weekends"
#   - All days: "everyday"
#
# The time to run the backup at should be in 24-hour format
# If the time is before 10 o'clock, there must be a zero in front of the hour
# For example: 03:00 (3 AM) or 13:00 (1 PM)
- days: 
  - "sunday"
  - "wednesday"
  time: "05:00"
- days: 
  - "monday"
  - "thursday"
  time: "23:30"

# Expandable list of things to back up
backup-list:
# An entry is comprised of four things:
#   - the file/folder path
#   - the file name format of the zip file to create
#   - whether this plugin should create the backup, or just upload it
#   - files to not include in the backup (optional)
#
# The file/folder path should be the path to the file/folder you want to backup, 
#   relative to the folder your server jar is in
# For more information about relative paths, see
#   http://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/absolute-path-vs-relative-path-linuxunix/
# To avoid overwriting data, ".." only affects the current working directory locally
#
# The file name format is the backup's naming scheme, this should contain a timestamp
# For more information about timedate formatting, see
#   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html
# Correct formatting is important, as this is how the plugin knows
#   which backup is the most recent!
#
# You can also use the blacklist to not include specified files/folders
# An entry should be the path to the file/folder relative to the folder you want to backup, for example:
#   blacklist:
#     - "dontbackup"
#     - "thesefolders"
#     - "orthisfile.txt"
- path: "world"
  format: "'Backup-world-'yyyy-M-d--HH-mm'.zip'"
  create: true
- path: "plugins"
  format: "'Backup-plugins-'yyyy-M-d--HH-mm'.zip'"
  create: true

# Expandable list of things to include in the backup from external sources
# For example, an external Bungeecord server or a mySQL database
external-backup-list:
# An entry is comprised of:
#   - the hostname of the external source
#   - the port
#   - the username
#   - the password (leave blank if no password)
#   - the file name format of the zip file to create
#   - the type of external source
#   - settings specific to a external source type
#
# The types of external sources currently supported are:
#   - ftpServer
#   - ftpsServer
#   - sftpServer
#   - mysqlDatabase
#
# Settings specific to FTP(S) and SFTP servers
#   - the base file path 
#   - the list of files/folders to backup
#
#   The base file path should be the path to the folder which all the paths to files/folders to backup are relative to
#
#   Each entry in the list of files/folders to backup should contain
#     - the path to the file/folder
#     - files to not include in the backup (optional)
#
#     Each path in the list of paths to files/folders to backup should be relative to the base file path
#

# Settings specific to SFTP servers
#   - the path to SFTP public key, relative to the "DriveBackupV2" folder (leave blank if not using public key authentication)

#
# Settings specific to MySQL servers
#   - a list of the names of the databases to backup
